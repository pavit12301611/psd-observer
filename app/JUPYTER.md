# 🐍 Setting Up Python (Jupyter Server) 

Python agents run on a Jupyter server with system-level access, enabling them to interact directly with your computer:

```python
#python <-- don't remove this!
print("Hello World!", response, agentId)

# Example: Analyze screen content and take action
if "SHUTOFF" in response:
    # System level commands can be executed here
    import os
    # os.system("command")  # Be careful with system commands!
```

## Jupyter Server Configuration

To use Python agents:

1. Run a Jupyter server on your machine with c.ServerApp.allow_origin = '*'
2. Configure the connection in the Observer AI interface:
   * Host: The server address (e.g., 127.0.0.1)
   * Port: The server port (e.g., 8888)
   * Token: Your Jupyter server authentication token
3. Test the connection using the "Test Connection" button
4. Switch to the Python tab in the code editor to write Python-based agents
